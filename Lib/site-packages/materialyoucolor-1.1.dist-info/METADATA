Material You color algorithms for python (crossplatform)!

SEE : https://m3.material.io/styles/color/dynamic-color/overview

## How does it works?
Android performs the following steps to generate color schemes from a user's wallpaper.

1. The system detects the main colors in the selected wallpaper image and extracts a source color.

2. The system uses that source color to further extrapolate five key colors known as Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Neutral, and Neutral variant.

3. The system interprets each key color into a tonal palette of 13 tones.

4. The system uses this single wallpaper to derive five different color schemes, which provides the basis for any light and dark themes.
